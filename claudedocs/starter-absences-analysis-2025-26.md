## Betting Intelligence

### Teams to Fade (High Absence Impact)

**Tier 1 - Critical Impact** (1.0+ absences per game):
- **GSW** (1.44) - 6 rotation players affected
- **SAS** (1.07) - De'Aaron Fox missing 57% of games
- **IND** (1.07) - Andrew Nembhard 47% availability
- **DET** (1.00) - 4 starters missing games

**Betting Strategy**:
- Fade spreads for these teams
- Consider unders on team totals
- Target opponent overs

### Teams to Target (Fully Healthy)

**Zero Starter Absences**:
- BOS, MIL, NYK, BKN, HOU, NOP, CHA

**Betting Strategy**:
- Back spreads for healthy teams vs injured teams
- Target overs for healthy offensive teams
- Strong ML opportunities

### Player Props Impact

**Players Missing Games = Opportunity for Teammates**

When these stars sit, target prop overs for:
- **Stephen Curry out** → Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody points/assists
- **Luka Dončić out** → Austin Reaves usage spike
- **Cade Cunningham out** → Jaden Ivey, Marcus Sasser props
- **Anthony Edwards out** → Mike Conley, Naz Reid opportunities

---

## Usage for Absence Impact Components

### Best Players for Test/Demo

**Ideal candidates** (played 5+, missed 3+, high minutes):

1. **Stephen Curry (GSW)** - 30.9 mpg, 13 played, 5 missed
2. **Luka Dončić (LAL)** - 36.8 mpg, 11 played, 4 missed
3. **Anthony Edwards (MIN)** - 30.8 mpg, 11 played, 4 missed
4. **Cade Cunningham (DET)** - 36.8 mpg, 11 played, 3 missed
5. **Domantas Sabonis (SAC)** - 33.3 mpg, 11 played, 4 missed

These players provide **meaningful with/without splits** for:
- `TeamPerformanceWithoutPlayer` - Team stats with/without star
- `PlayerPerformanceWithoutTeammate` - Teammate prop adjustments
- `PlayerAbsenceImpact` - Overall team dependency analysis

## Data Refresh

**Script**: `/1.DATABASE/etl/populate_absences_smart.py`

**Run frequency**: Daily after game completion

```bash
python3 /Users/chapirou/dev/perso/stat-discute.be/1.DATABASE/etl/populate_absences_smart.py 2025-26
```

**Detection Logic**:
- Identifies rotation players (last 10 games, 5+ played, 20+ mpg)
- Compares roster vs actual participants per game
- Marks absence when rotation player doesn't have stats

---

## Methodology

**Starter Definition**:
- Average 20+ minutes per game when active
- Played in 5+ games (establish baseline)
- Missed 3+ games (meaningful absence sample)

**Impact Score Calculation**:
```
Impact Score = Total Starter Games Missed ÷ Total Team Games Played
```

Higher score = team more affected by absences

**Availability %**:
```
Availability = (Games Played ÷ Total Team Games) × 100
```
